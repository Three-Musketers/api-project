Demo Tips

1. Plan what you are going to demo and practice it on the live site. That way you won’t be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
2. Deploy early so you can squash bugs. There are always bugs on the live site at first.
3. Add link to your live project to your DEMO slide so you can start it smoothly.
4. Your app’s colors and sizing might look different on the projector. If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.
